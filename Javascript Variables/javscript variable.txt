=>Javascript Variables

-> variables are simpley storage locations in memory where you can store a value and use it as a part of any expression. 
-> Javacript variables are implicitly typed. that data type of variable will be determind according to the value assigned. They do not 
   have any pre-defined datatypes.
-> Javascript allows to use variable dairectly without defining it. if no t in strict mode.
   syntax:
           x = 10;  // consider it as a integer
           x = "krishna" // considar it as a string 
           x = true; // considar it as a boolean

-> Javascript variables must be definied if it is strict mood "use strict"

-> Javascript variables are decelerad by using following keywords.
      1) Var
      2) let
      3) const

 1) Var:

-> var is a used to define function scope variable. it is accessible any where within the function.
 NOTE: VAR CAN NOT BE DEFINED OUTSDIDE OF FUNCTION.

2) let:

-> let is used to define a block scope variable, so that it is not accessible outside the specified block.
-> The variables declared using "var" and "let" will allow shadowing, which is the process of defining same name identifier with different
    value.

3) const:

-> The keyword "const" is used to declare a constant value that cannot be overridden. which means it will not allow shadowing.
-> for example is i entered "const a = 20" and then later in code i entered "const 1 =40;" it means code is invalide and it will not show
   new value.


         KEYWORD        SCOPE               SHADOWING
->         var            function            yes
->         let            block               yes
->         const          block               no  




-> Javascript variables supports hoisting("hoisting means you can declare variable anywhere inside funcation"), which is a process used by 
   translator where it will process the code declaration followed by code rendering. irrespective of the sequential order of the 
   statements. 


=> THE GLOBAL SCOPE FOR VARIABLE

-> The global scope for variable is defined by declaring it outside of function and within the <script> element. (element means tag).

=> a global scope for variable can be defined within function by using the keyword "window". EXAMPLE "window.x"


=> JAVASCRIPT variables are case-sensitive. 

     syntax: 
         const x=10; // this syntax is valid because it is small "x"
         const X=10; // this syntax is valid because it is capital "X"
         this both are deffirent identifier in javascript.
    
     EXAMPLE:
               var name="darshan";     // this both are correct
               var Name="brahmbhatt";  //


=> A javascript variable name must start with alphabet or with underscore ("_")
         EXAMPLE:
                   var name;        //  Valid (Because it starts with alphabet)
                   var _name;       //  Valid  (Because it starts with underscore "_" )
                   var 2ndname;     //  Invalid (Because it start with number.[variable name can not start with number or any other sign])
                   var first name;  //  Invalid (because there should be no space beetween two words or you need to joint them with 
                                        underscore (_)
